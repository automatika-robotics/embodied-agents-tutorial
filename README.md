# Tutorial for ROSCon Strasbourg

## Getting Started
1. The easiest way to get started is to install docker and run a jazzy ROS container with the following:

```shell
docker run -it --network host ros:humble-ros-base
```

2. Install the packages as per installation instructions sent in the email.

3. As we run recipes, you will be prompted for installing additional packages based on recipe requirements. First recipe requires `pip install ollama`
